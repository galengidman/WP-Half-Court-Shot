Bio
=======================
WP Half-Court shot integrates mediaHACK's Half-Court Shot jsApp (https://github.com/galengidman/WP-Half-Court-Shot) into WordPress via shortcode.


=======================
Installation
=======================
Download the plugin and upload it to WordPress via the admin panel or FTP "wp-hcs.php" into WordPress's "plugins" directory.


=======================
Configuration
=======================
For now there are only two options: your username and the number of shots you want to return. Here's what it might look like for me...

[hcs jersey="galen" shots="12"]

Should be pretty self explanatory. ;)
